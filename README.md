## 👋 About Me

I am a Web3 and blockchain developer focused on building decentralized applications, smart contracts, and DeFi systems.  
My current learning and building journey revolves around **privacy-preserving technologies**, **FHE-based systems**, and **modern blockchain infrastructure**.

I believe in:
- Learning by building
- Writing clean, understandable code
- Sharing progress publicly
- Improving systems step by step
